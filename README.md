## Introduction

The [Falco Plugin Rust SDK](https://github.com/falcosecurity/plugin-sdk-rs/) allows you to write custom plugins for [Falco](https://falco.org/), an open-source runtime security tool.

This project's goal is to walk you through the [Falco Plugin architecture](https://falco.org/docs/plugins/architecture/) and help you get started writing plugins using the Rust SDK.

### The Rustlings project

This repository has been set up as third-party Rustlings exercises.
Rustlings is a project that teaches you interactively with small exercises you can complete in your own time.

Follow the official [instructions](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustlings) to install Rustlings, then clone this repository, open a terminal in this directory, and run `rustlings` to get started with the exercises ðŸš€

## Exercises

The exercises are designed to be completed in order, with each one building on concepts from the previous ones. If you get stuck, please take a look at the resources section for help.

Similar to the core `rustlings` exercises, you will need to search for `TODO` and `todo!()` to discover the areas that need to be changed,
you can press `h` to get hints, and you may find a solution ready in the `solutions/` directory.
In addition to that, you'll find `DOCS` with pointers to the relevant SDK documentation.

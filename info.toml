Welcome to the Falco Plugin Rust SDK exercises!

These exercises will walk you through the process of developing Falco Plugins using
the Rust SDK. You may want to open the Rust SDK Documenation
(https://falcosecurity.github.io/plugin-sdk-rs) in a separate browser window
as a reference.

Each exercise has a partially complete implementation of a plugin. Your job is to
identify the missing components and fill them in.

After saving your changes, the framework will build the plugin and run tests that
verify that your changes correctly implement the exercise.

Just tl;dr:
1. exercises usually contain some compiler or logic errors
2. search for `TODO` and `todo!()` in the code
3. if you're stuck on an exercise, enter `h` to show a hint.

Congratulations! You can now create your own Falco plugin in Rust!

Where to go next? It's very easy to build your plugin and load it into Falco.
Don't believe us? We took the code for the sourcing and extract plugin you just worked on
and can show you that it can be built with a single `cargo` command, then loaded
and tested with a single `docker` command: https://github.com/madchicken/rand-generator-plugin

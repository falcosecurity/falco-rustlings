Welcome to these Falco Plugin Rust SDK exercises!
If you're not familiar with Rustlings, we encourage you to check out the main Rustlings repository first.
Just tl;dr:
1. exercises usually contain some compiler or logic errors
2. search for `TODO` and `todo!()` in the code
3. if you're stuck on an exercise, enter `h` to show a hint.
